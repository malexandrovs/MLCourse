Therefore we can, after executing the following cell, use stuff like `np.array` and `np.sqrt`. Check out the [NumPy Reference](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html) and especially search it using e.g. [Google Site Search](https://www.google.de/search?q=array+site%3Adocs.scipy.org%2Fdoc%2Fnumpy)!
